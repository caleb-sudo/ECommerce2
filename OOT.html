                  Perhaps the biggest question Stephen Hawking tried to answer in his extraordinary life was how the universe could have created conditions so 
                  perfectly hospitable to life. In order to solve this mystery, Hawking studied the big bang origin of the universe, but his early work ran into a 
                  crisis when the math predicted many big bangs producing a multiverseâ€”countless different universes, most of which would be far too bizarre to 
                  harbor life.

                  Holed up in the theoretical physics department at Cambridge, Stephen Hawking and his friend and collaborator Thomas Hertog worked on this problem 
                  for twenty years, developing a new theory of the cosmos that could account for the emergence of life. Peering into the extreme quantum physics of 
                  cosmic holograms and venturing far back in time to our deepest roots, they were startled to find a deeper level of evolution in which the physical 
                  laws themselves transform and simplify until particles, forces, and even time itself fades away. This discovery led them to a revolutionary 
                  idea: The laws of physics are not set in stone but are born and co-evolve as the universe they govern takes shape. As Hawking`s final days drew near, 
                  the two collaborators published their theory, which proposed a radical new Darwinian perspective on the origins of our universe.
